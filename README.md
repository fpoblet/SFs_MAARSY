We use the Taylor approximation to calculate spatial high-order structure functions (SFs) from a time sequences of horizontal winds in the troposphere/stratosphere. The data is provided by A powerful VHF radar on the North-Norwegian island Andøya (69.30°N, 16.04°E), called Middle Atmosphere Alomar Radar System (MAARSY).
