## Project Overview

This repository contains code that uses the Taylor approximation to calculate spatial high-order structure functions (SFs) of horizontal winds from time sequences of measurements in the troposphere and stratosphere. The data are collected using a powerful VHF radar located on the North-Norwegian island of Andøya (69.30°N, 16.04°E). The radar system used is the Middle Atmosphere Alomar Radar System (MAARSY).

## About the Radar
