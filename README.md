The codes provided here use the Taylor approximation to calculate spatial high-order structure functions (SFs) of horizontal winds from a time sequences of measurements in the troposphere/stratosphere. The data are measured with a powerful VHF radar on the North-Norwegian island of Andøya (69.30°N, 16.04°E). The radar name is Middle Atmosphere Alomar Radar System (MAARSY).
